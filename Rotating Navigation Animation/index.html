            <h1>If My Dog Could Talk Personalized Story Book</h1>
            <small>Shiba in Việt Nam</small>
            <p>If your dog could talk, imagine the things you’d learn! This book celebrates your beloved family pet, and
                explains—from a canine perspective—all the funny things he does. The dog’s name appears on the book
                cover and throughout the book (there’s also space for family members’ names), and you can personalize
                the illustration to create a dog that looks just like your own. A personal message from you printed at
                the front and back of the book makes it extra giftable for kids and adults alike. This 8x8 hardcover
                story book is intended for children of all ages.</p>

            <h3>My Dog</h3>

            <p>When the kid got 20+ presents on Xmas, he instantly forgot about the rest when he opened this one. He
                placed this book on the very top of his mountain of gifts as the "winner." He screamed in excitement &
                has read it 30 times in the last 3 days. He keeps screaming, "I love it, love it, looove it!!! If
                Christmas was the Grammy Awards, then this book would have won Record of the Year, Album of the Year,
                Song of the Year, and Artist of the Year. I cannot overstate how much of a HIT it was!!!</p>
